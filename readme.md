# Meal Generator

There's all this unprepared food in the fridge, and I don't want to invest the cognitive or creative energy to decide what to cook. Can't a simple script do that for me? Yes!

## How to use

Categorize your foods, and enter them as comma-separated values into the labeled input fields. Then, hit the big button to generate an idea for a meal that you can prepare. You can press the button again if you'd like.
